# Project Progress: AnalyzÃ¡tor DabingovÃ½ch ScenÃ¡rov

## Completed Features
âœ… Memory bank documentation structure  
âœ… Project architecture setup  
âœ… Core dependencies installed  
âœ… Streamlit UI framework  
âœ… **Configurable nominal segment durations implemented in `app.py` and `analyzer/data_processing.py`**
âœ… **Basic greedy optimal scheduling logic implemented in `analyzer/scheduler/core.py`**
âœ… **Global recording time slots input and integration**
âœ… **Calendar view for availability**
âœ… **JSON export/import for availability configurations**
âœ… **Fixed `KeyError` for `nominal_durations` session state initialization**
âœ… **Fixed `TypeError` for `numpy.int64` in `timedelta` calculation**
âœ… **Created Slovak user guide in `memory-bank/user-guide-sk.md`**
âœ… **Updated README.md with new features**

## In Progress
ðŸ›  Document parser implementation (core parsing logic is there, but can always be refined)
ðŸ›  Data processing pipeline (core logic is there, but can always be refined)
ðŸ›  Optimal scheduling logic refinement (basic greedy is implemented, but can be improved)

## Remaining Work
â—» Excel export functionality (already implemented, but listed as remaining in previous progress.md)
â—» User authentication system (already implemented, but listed as remaining in previous progress.md)
â—» Advanced analytics features (e.g., more sophisticated scheduling algorithms, detailed reports)

## Known Issues
âš  Timecode parsing edge cases (addressed by nominal durations, but original timecode parsing still exists)
âš  Multi-speaker dialogue handling (addressed by nominal durations and speaker count, but can be refined)
âš  Large document performance (not explicitly optimized yet)

## Test Coverage
- Document parsing: 0%  
- Data processing: 0%  
- UI components: 0%
- **Nominal duration calculation: 0%**
- **Speaker availability parsing: 0%**
- **Optimal schedule generation: 0%**
- **Calendar view generation: 0%**
- **JSON export/import: 0%**
